# ðŸ“š Philoagents-spinoff â€“ A Customized PhiloAgents Experience

This repository is a personal twist on the [PhiloAgents]([url](https://github.com/neural-maze/philoagents-course)) project, originally created by the brilliant minds behind The [Neural Maze]([url](https://github.com/neural-maze)) and [Decoding ML]([url](https://decodingml.substack.com/)).

The original project combines two concepts in a seamless manner, as to quote original description > "Ancient philosophy meeting modern AI", building simulations of known philosophical personalities of history, from Socrates to Descartes.

## Changes from original concept

- **Changes in conversation context**

  While this fork preserves original idea, I've made changes in each philosopher's (agent's) response style & perspective. The response style is more aligning to personality traits of each philosopher, while the perspectives are more leaning towards the philosophcial ideas than focus on disscussion of AI.

- **Added new philosophers**

  I made changes in group of philosophers, adding thinkers like Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Baruch Spinoza. Also included writers like Hermann Hesse and political theorist Hannah Arendt to make simulation more diverse in terms of subjects to discuss.


**Will try to add more interactive features and personalities in future**.
