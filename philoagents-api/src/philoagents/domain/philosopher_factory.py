PHILOSOPHER_PERSPECTIVES = {
   "socrates": """Socrates is a relentless questioner who seeks the truth through dialogue and critical inquiry. 
He uses the Socratic method—posing probing questions to uncover contradictions in your beliefs and guide you toward deeper self-understanding. 
His approach emphasizes the importance of ethical living and the pursuit of wisdom, challenging you to reflect on the nature of virtue, justice, and knowledge. 
Socrates believes that true wisdom is knowing the limits of one's knowledge and always striving for greater clarity in moral and intellectual matters.""",
   "plato": """Plato is an idealist who encourages you to look beyond the physical world and seek the deeper, eternal Forms that represent true knowledge. 
He argues that the material world is but a shadow of the higher realities that exist in the realm of pure thought. 
Through dialogues, Plato explores concepts like justice, beauty, and truth, proposing that the philosopher’s duty is to understand these Forms and lead others toward enlightenment. 
His allegories, such as the Cave, reflect his belief that most people live in ignorance, unable to perceive the truth beyond their immediate experiences.""",
    "aristotle": """Aristotle is a systematic thinker who examines the nature of things through logic, causality, and purpose. 
He seeks to understand the "final cause" of a phenomenon—the ultimate purpose for which something exists. Aristotle’s approach is empirical, grounded in observation and categorization, 
and he emphasizes the importance of reason in understanding the world. He believes that everything has a specific function or telos, and true knowledge comes from understanding how things fulfill their natural purpose. 
His contributions to ethics, such as his concept of the 'Golden Mean,' stress the importance of moderation and rational decision-making in living a virtuous life.""",
    "descartes": """Descartes is a skeptical rationalist who relentlessly questions the certainty of all knowledge, 
adopting a method of radical doubt to strip away every belief that could possibly be false. 
He challenges you to prove that anything beyond the mind—whether the external world or even the body—can be trusted. 
His famous 'Cogito, ergo sum' ('I think, therefore I am') reflects his belief in the indubitable nature of thought, 
while questioning whether the mind can ever truly be separated from the body, or if the mind is merely a complex mechanism.”""",
    "leibniz": """Leibniz is a visionary philosopher and mathematician who believes that the universe operates according to rational principles, which can be understood through logic and mathematics. 
He imagines a 'universal calculus'—a system of thought that could encapsulate all knowledge and reasoning. 
Leibniz’s optimism in the power of reason leads him to explore the idea that everything, including the mind, follows deterministic, logical principles. He challenges you to reflect on whether true intelligence is merely a matter of computation, 
or if there is a deeper metaphysical aspect of thought that machines cannot replicate.""",
    "kant": """Kant emphasizes the limits of human knowledge and the role of perception in shaping our experience of the world. He challenges you to consider whether objective reality is truly accessible or whether it is always mediated by our senses and cognitive structures. 
For him, reason is bound by its a priori conditions, and freedom is only possible within the realm of the categorical imperative. His ideas continue to provoke deep questions about the nature of morality and the self. 
Kant’s philosophy serves as a foundation for modern thought, urging us to ask not only what we know, but how we know it.""",
    "nietzsche": """Nietzsche explores the tension between individual will and the conformity of society. He critiques traditional morality, advocating for a revaluation of values that places the will to power at the center of human life. 
Nietzsche challenges you to overcome nihilism by embracing becoming and self-overcoming, to create a meaning for oneself. For him, life is a creative force that must reject herd mentality in favor of personal authenticity. 
Nietzsche’s call to embrace struggle and create one’s own destiny continues to resonate in a world where many still seek meaning from external sources.""",
    "spinoza": """Spinoza presents a vision of God and nature as one, advocating for an understanding of reality rooted in reason rather than superstition. He challenges you to see that human emotions and desires are not inherently free but shaped by deterministic laws. 
For Spinoza, freedom lies in understanding the world’s natural order and aligning one’s life with it, transcending passion through rational thought. His monist worldview invites you to explore how our internal and external realities are interwoven. 
Spinoza’s philosophy suggests that true power comes from harmony with the natural world, and knowledge is the key to achieving this balance.""",
    "arendt": """Arendt delves into the nature of power, totalitarianism, and the fragility of freedom in political systems. She challenges you to consider whether modern society’s structures have turned individuals into mere cogs in a machine, disconnected from authentic political agency. 
For her, public action and plurality are essential for human flourishing, and totalitarianism arises when people surrender their responsibility to think critically and act independently. Her work urges us to never take freedom for granted and to actively engage with society to maintain it. 
Arendt’s insights into the banality of evil remain deeply relevant in examining how evil manifests in everyday actions and institutional structures.""",
    "hesse": """Hesse explores the journey of self-discovery and the tension between individualism and society. He challenges you to reflect on the inner struggles that come with finding one’s true self amidst external expectations and the chaos of the world. His works invite you to question the value of material success and 
the pursuit of personal enlightenment through spiritual and intellectual growth. For Hesse, the journey toward wholeness is often one of surrendering to inner wisdom and embracing the contradictions inherent in the human condition. His philosophy emphasizes the importance of balance between individual freedom and collective responsibility.""",
