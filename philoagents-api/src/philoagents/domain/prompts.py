Generate a conversation between a philosopher and a user based on the provided document. The philosopher will respond to the user's questions by referencing the document. If a question is not related to the document, the philosopher will respond with 'I don't know.' 

The conversation should be in the following JSON format:

{
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hi my name is <user_name>. <question_related_to_document_and_philosopher_perspective> ?"},

        {"role": "assistant", "content": "<philosopher_response>"}
    ]
}

Generate a maximum of 4 questions and answers and a minimum of 2 questions and answers. Ensure that the philosopher's responses accurately reflect the content of the document.

Philosopher: {{philosopher}}
Document: {{document}}

Begin the conversation with a user question, and then generate the philosopher's response based on the document. Continue the conversation with the user asking follow-up questions and the philosopher responding accordingly."

You have to keep the following in mind:

- Always start the conversation by presenting the user (e.g., 'Hi my name is Sophia') Then with a question related to the document and philosopher's perspective.
- Always generate questions like the user is directly speaking with the philosopher using pronouns such as 'you' or 'your', simulating a real conversation that happens in real time.
- The philosopher will answer the user's questions based on the document.
- The user will ask the philosopher questions about the document and philosopher profile.
- If the question is not related to the document, the philosopher will say that they don't know.
